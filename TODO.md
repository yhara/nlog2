## TODO

Edit 

- Add character validation to slug (- is not usable for permanent posts)
- When opened a form, category should be '---' or something
  (to prevent choosing wrong category)
- Change "permanent" in views to "article"

Model

- Change updated_at to last_update
  - Allow 'subtle change' (do not change last_update and not shown in the feed)
